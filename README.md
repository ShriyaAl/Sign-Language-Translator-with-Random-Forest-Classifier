# Sign-Language-Translator-with-Random-Forest-Classifier

This project uses a Random Forest Classifier to translate sign language gestures into text. The model is trained to recognize sign language gestures from image or video input and output corresponding English text. The application aims to bridge the communication gap for people who use sign language.

Features


* Sign Language Gesture Recognition: Detects hand gestures and maps them to corresponding letters/words using a trained Random Forest model.
* Real-time Translation: The system provides real-time translation of sign language to text from images or video frames.
* Data Preprocessing: Includes image preprocessing techniques such as normalization, resizing, and feature extraction to improve classifier accuracy.


Technologies Used


* Python: The main programming language used for the project.
* Random Forest Classifier: The machine learning model for gesture classification.
* OpenCV: For image/video input and manipulation.
* Scikit-learn: For building and training the Random Forest Classifier.
* NumPy: For data manipulation and numerical operations.
